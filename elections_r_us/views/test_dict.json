          u'referendumConStatement': u'ARGUMENT AGAINST:\n\nWe do need a minimum wage that benefits everyone \u2013 workers, consumers and small businesses \u2013 a wage that considers different costs of living across the state, the unique pay structures of certain jobs, and the need for a training wage for new workers. Unfortunately, I-1433 is a poorly crafted proposal that will do more harm than good for workers and the Washington economy.\n\n Makes State Budget Problems Worse\n\n The initiative raises $85 million in new taxes, but will increase state spending by $363 million. The state is in contempt for failing to fund education and must find billions of dollars to fund our schools. This will make the problem worse. \n\n Seattle Hasn\u2019t Delivered\n\n Seattle passed a $15 per hour minimum wage. The City of Seattle\u2019s economists acknowledge the initial increase to $11 per hour has not benefitted workers. While average pay per hour rose, workers are getting fewer hours and there are fewer jobs available. Meanwhile, consumers are paying more for less. Small businesses are hurting.\n\n A University of Washington study warned most communities around our state can\u2019t absorb a 30% wage increase. This means fewer jobs and small businesses, steeper prices in stores, and less opportunity for young people to obtain work experience.\n\n We Can\u2019t Afford The Risk\n\n Washington State already has the 8th highest minimum wage. This will make it more difficult for young people to find jobs. Adding new mandates and jumping the minimum wage by 30% is a risk that workers, consumers and small businesses can\u2019t afford.  \n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION:\n\nhttps://weiapplets.sos.wa.gov/myvote/onlinevotersguide/Measures?electionid=63&countycode=XX',
          u'referendumProStatement': u'ARGUMENT FOR:\n\nInitiative 1433 is good for our workers, our families, and our economy\n\n Initiative 1433 ensures every Washington worker can earn paid sick and safe leave and phases in a $13.50 minimum wage by 2020.\n\n Putting our health and safety first\n\n Washingtonians should be able to take care of themselves or a sick child without having to choose between their family and a paycheck. It\u2019s vitally important to pass a common sense law like paid sick leave to help prevent the spread of disease and keep customers, employees, children, the elderly, and our families safe. \n\n When restaurant, grocery, and childcare workers are forced to go to work sick they expose our communities to disease. In fact, 70% of food-related norovirus outbreaks are the result of sick food workers showing up to work.\n\n Creating more economic opportunity\n\n Initiative 1433 would boost the income of more than 730,000 low-wage workers, lifting families out of poverty and growing the economy. When workers have more money to spend, they spend it at local businesses. Initiative 1433 will inject nearly $2.5 billion into local economies. This demand, in turn, creates more good-paying jobs. That\u2019s why every state that raised the minimum wage in 2014 saw faster job growth than those that left wages stagnant. Put simply, this initiative helps businesses, workers, and families across Washington thrive. \n\n By voting \u201cYes\u201d on Initiative 1433, we can make Washington a better place to live, work, and raise a family.\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION:\n\nhttps://weiapplets.sos.wa.gov/myvote/onlinevotersguide/Measures?electionid=63&countycode=XX\n\n----------',

          u'referendumConStatement': u'ARGUMENT AGAINST:\n\nInitiative 1464 uses your tax dollars to tilt the political system in favor of politicians and out of state special interests, while depriving our schools of resources to fully fund education. We shouldn\u2019t put politicians before our kids.   \n\n Benefits Politicians and Political Consultants \n\n The initiative allows politicians to pay themselves for \u201clost wages\u201d using public funds. Taxpayer dollars will be used to pay politicians to run for office. The system will be ripe for abuse. It\u2019s no surprise the initiative is sponsored by politicians and political consultants who will personally benefit from the use of taxpayer funds. It is funded by billionaires and out-of-state special interests trying to create an uneven playing field in their favor.   \n\n Wrong Priorities \n\n Our state is under court order to fully fund education and is subject to a $100,000 per day fine. Instead of funding our schools, the initiative gives $285 million in taxpayer money to political consultants and politicians to spend on mudslinging and negative attack ads.   \n\n The initiative allows people living in Washington who are non-citizens to contribute taxpayer dollars to politicians, even though they can\u2019t vote.   \n\n Hurts Small Businesses, But Exempts Special Interests \n\n The initiative hurts Washington small businesses by raising $285 million in taxes on their customers over the next ten years. This will hurt tourism and kill jobs. The initiative also restricts free speech for minority-owned small businesses but provides exemptions for corporate lobbyists. Powerful special interests get special treatment.  Vote no on this bad idea.\n\nREBUTTAL OF ARGUMENT FOR:\n\nDespite claims by I-1464\u2019s out-of-state backers, Washington is already nationally recognized as being a leader on transparency and ethical reporting. I-1464 would wreck that. The initiative pours money into politics, giving $285 million in taxpayer dollars to politicians instead of our schools. It will raise taxes on Washington businesses, hurt our tourism industry and attack the rights of minority small business owners while providing loopholes for corporate lobbyists.

          u'referendumProStatement': u'ARGUMENT FOR:\n\nBig money interests and lobbyists have too much control over our political system, while regular people have very little. Initiative 1464 implements concrete, achievable reforms to make politicians and government more accountable to the people. \n\n Transparency and Accountability \n\n Initiative 1464 sheds light on dark money and SuperPACs by requiring political ads say who is really paying for them. It requires online public reporting of lobbyist activity, spending and compensation.   \n\n Limits Big Money Influence \n\n Initiative 1464 bars lobbyists and public contractors from making big campaign contributions. It stops the revolving door of government officials taking jobs as lobbyists as soon as they leave office. It toughens enforcement of ethics and campaign finance laws, and strengthens penalties for those who break them.   \n\n Empowers Voters \n\n Initiative 1464 gives regular people a stronger voice by enabling each person to decide if they want to direct some of their own tax dollars to support candidates of their choice. This also helps new types of candidates run for office even if they aren\u2019t wealthy or well-connected to big donors.    \n\n A Big Step for Washington \n\n If we want things to change, we have to reform the campaign finance system so regular people have more power in politics. Initiative 1464 makes commonsense reforms proven to work in other states and pays for itself by closing a tax loophole. We can\u2019t fix every problem or get all money out of politics, but if we do nothing, nothing will change. This is a big step in the right direction.\n\nREBUTTAL OF ARGUMENT AGAINST:\n\nInitiative 1464 requires transparency and accountability, limits big money influence, strengthens rules on all lobbyists and politicians, and empowers each taxpayer to decide whether or not to direct funds to candidates. The fiscal impact statement and Washington Budget and Policy Center agree: It doesn\u2019t take money from schools and doesn\u2019t hurt jobs. Sadly, the lobbyists who wrote the arguments against 1464 are not required to tell the truth.

          u'referendumConStatement': u'ARGUMENT AGAINST:\n\nI-1491 Duplicates Existing Laws   \n\n I-1491 disregards existing state laws that already require treatment and restriction of potentially dangerous individuals.  I-1491 doesn\u2019t require evaluation, treatment, or monitoring and does nothing to address underlying issues.  Recently implemented laws actually provide early detection and intervention of persons at danger to themselves or others.    \n\n Stigmatizes Mental Illness   \n\n I-1491 associates mental illness with mass shootings and violent crime.  Statistics show that only 3%-5% of violent acts are committed by people with serious mental illness.  The vast majority of people with mental illness are not violent and are ten times more likely to be victims of violent crime than the general population.   \n\n Violates Rights   \n\n A broadly defined set of people, including former roommates and police, can file a petition against you.  Due process is undermined by allowing immediate ex parte orders; hearings and judgments without notice to the accused person.  The definition of \u201cExtreme Risk\u201d is unclear.  A judge can issue an order based on arbitrary factors and reported behaviors including simply purchasing a gun legally.  To be released from an order, a person must prove he/she is not a danger to themselves or others and pay for the tremendous cost of their own defense.   \n\n Gives False Sense of Security   \n\n There is no evidence that such orders reduce mass shootings and violent crime. \n\n Restrictions on firearm ownership should not be based on ideological agendas manipulating public fears and misconceptions about gun violence.  I-1491 is a targeted, discriminatory abridgement of Second Amendment rights.  Vote No!\n\nREBUTTAL OF ARGUMENT FOR:\n\nIneffective! We all want to reduce tragedy, but I-1491 doesn\u2019t include treatment of allegedly dangerous people, and doesn\u2019t remove other dangerous items (vehicles, knives\u2026). Misdirected! I-1491 ignores that 95-97% of violent crimes are not related to mental illness. Deceptive! In Isla Vista, the parents told police they \u201cfound it difficult to believe their son either owned weapons or would actually hurt anyone.\u201d Unintended consequences! Confiscating firearms doesn\u2019t make someone stable, it makes them mad.\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION:\n\nhttps://weiapplets.sos.wa.gov/myvote/onlinevotersguide/Measures?electionid=63&countycode=XX',
          u'referendumProStatement': u'ARGUMENT FOR:\n\nWashington State has taken important steps to keep guns out of dangerous hands. But there are still gaps in our laws that make it hard to keep guns away from people threatening violence against themselves or others.  We know that the majority of mass shooters and individuals who attempt suicide show signs of their intentions, but current law leaves families and law enforcement - often first to see those warning signs - unable to take life-saving action.     \n\n Initiative 1491: Empower Families, Prevent Gun Violence   \n\n Initiative 1491 empowers families and law enforcement to prevent tragedy -- giving them a chance to remove guns from a dangerous situation when they know someone is a threat to themselves or others. Parents of shooters at Isla Vista, Seattle\u2019s Cafe Racer, and other tragedies have said they could have used this type of law to prevent senseless violence. Initiative 1491 would also expand protections that keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers. Similar laws in other states have been shown to prevent some suicides.   \n\n Initiative 1491: Respect Due Process   \n\n Initiative 1491 closely follows existing process for other civil protection orders. Both parties may present evidence in court. A judge determines whether evidence of danger is sufficient and issues an order, effective for one year. There are criminal penalties for false petitions.   \n\n Initiative 1491: Community Support   \n\n Endorsed by Washington State Public Health Association, League of Women Voters, Faith Action Network, Everytown for Gun Safety, law enforcement, domestic violence experts, gun owners, and gun violence survivors.\n\nREBUTTAL OF ARGUMENT AGAINST:\n\nInitiative 1491 fills a critical need in Washington\u2019s proven, established protection order system. It simply gives families a tool to save lives\u2014 keeping guns from loved ones who are likely to use them for violence to themselves or others. Initiative 1491 is a targeted, tested way to keep guns out of dangerous hands and respect due process\u2014endorsed by mental health professionals, law enforcement and suicide prevention advocates.\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION:\n\nhttps://weiapplets.sos.wa.gov/myvote/onlinevotersguide/Measures?electionid=63&countycode=XX\n\n----------',

          u'referendumConStatement': u'ARGUMENT AGAINST:\n\nPlease vote no. Initiative 1501 isn\u2019t what it claims to be. It was given an innocent-sounding title to deceive voters as to its true purpose. Initiative 1501 is an attack on vulnerable individuals by a powerful special interest that has poured over $1.2 million into funding it. \n\n Initiative 1501 was written by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). Its goal is to rewrite the Public Records Act to prevent in-home caregivers and childcare providers from learning they no longer can be forced to pay dues to the union. \n\n Through Initiative 1501, SEIU ensures that it, and only it, will still receive caregivers\u2019 information \u2014 even Social Security numbers \u2014 so it can continue capturing over $20 million in dues from these individuals every year. Caregivers have the right to stop paying SEIU, but the State isn\u2019t informing them of their right. If Initiative 1501 passes, caregivers will not even be able to contact each other to discuss issues of common concern. \n\n Initiative 1501 is a shameless attempt by a powerful special interest to diminish government transparency and the rights of hard-working caregivers. Our strong government transparency laws should not be weakened to oppress low wage workers. Every person deserves to know his or her rights. Initiative 1501 empowers only the already-powerful. \n\n Our Public Records Act, one of the best in the nation, shouldn\u2019t be manipulated for the enrichment of a wealthy special interest and for the purpose of keeping in-home caregivers and childcare workers in the dark. \n\nREBUTTAL OF ARGUMENT FOR:\n\nDon\u2019t be deceived. The only two caregivers who helped draft the I-1501 pro statement are SEIU activists, not ordinary workers. That\u2019s because the measure only benefits union executives, not hard-working caregivers. It has nothing to do with protecting seniors from identity theft. It\u2019s all about keeping caregivers from discovering they no longer have to share their paychecks with the union. Follow the money. I-1501 protects union bosses\u2019 wallets while hurting workers and vulnerable individuals.\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION:\n\nhttps://weiapplets.sos.wa.gov/myvote/onlinevotersguide/Measures?electionid=63&countycode=XX',
          u'referendumProStatement': u'ARGUMENT FOR:\n\nConsumer Fraud and Identity Theft Hurt Us All\n\n You have heard the news and stories from family and friends targeted in scams. They often start with a telemarketer impersonating the IRS or a relative in distress, demanding money or personal information. With basic information, criminals can steal an identity, causing emotional stress, devastating personal finances and ruining credit. Fraud and identity theft hurt all of us and cause real financial and emotional damage. \n\n We Need to Protect Seniors and Other Vulnerable People\n\n According to a recent study, over half of scam victims are over age 50.  In fact, financial exploitation of seniors costs them $2.9 billion every year. For every case that is reported, it is estimated that 43 others are not.   \n\n As caregivers, advocates for seniors and retired people, and a public safety official, our priority is the health, safety and protection of our state\u2019s most vulnerable populations.  We cannot let fraudulent telemarketers and other criminals continue to prey on them. We need the protections offered by I-1501 for their peace of mind and safety.\n\n Increase Penalties and Prevent Release of Personal Information\n\n I-1501 increases penalties on criminals who prey on senior citizens and other vulnerable people. It prevents the government from releasing information that could help identity thieves targeting seniors and the vulnerable. And it protects the personal information of caregivers.   \n\n Initiative 1501 is endorsed by consumer advocates, caregivers, law enforcement and public safety officials, and other community leaders. Please join us in approving Initiative 1501.  \n\nREBUTTAL OF ARGUMENT AGAINST:\n\n Senior citizens, vulnerable people, and their caregivers are not special interests. When they are the victims of fraud or identity theft, they deserve justice in the form of increased penalties on the perpetrators of their crimes. I-1501 will discourage fraudulent telemarketers and scam artists from profiting on our personal information and increase penalties when they do. I-1501 is supported by the Washington State Senior Citizens\u2019 Lobby because they recognize we all need its protections. \n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION:\n\nhttps://weiapplets.sos.wa.gov/myvote/onlinevotersguide/Measures?electionid=63&countycode=XX\n\n----------',

          u'referendumConStatement': u'ARGUMENT AGAINST:\n\nState Deficit\n\n I-732 will make Washington\u2019s budget mess worse. A Department of Revenue analysis found I-732 will cut funding available for education, health care, and other vital services by $797 million over the next six years. Our state faces a $5 billion deficit and court orders to meet basic education and mental health needs. I-732 makes this situation worse.\n\n Climate and Jobs\n\n Climate policy must be comprehensive, so it doesn\u2019t harm people and kill jobs. I-732 fails this test. A clean-energy economy can reduce carbon emissions and reverse climate change while also creating family-wage jobs, rebuilding crumbling infrastructure, investing in areas hardest hit by pollution, and providing a \u201cJust Transition\u201d for workers and communities. I-732 doesn\u2019t do any of this.\n\n Instead, I-732 imposes an accelerating carbon tax on businesses, with no provisions for compliance flexibility or energy-efficiency incentives. Some businesses will simply move their jobs and pollution across state lines. \n\n Equity\n\n Vulnerable families in communities near pollution hot spots and workers in energy intensive industries are hardest hit by pollution. But I-732\u2019s \u201cWorking Families Tax Exemption\u201d provides less than half of this population with any relief from increased energy costs. These communities will need investments and jobs to make an equitable transition to a forward-thinking clean-energy economy. I-732 ignores this.\n\n At a time when we are struggling to maintain good jobs and fund basic services, I-732 would send Washington in the wrong direction. Vote NO.\n\nREBUTTAL OF ARGUMENT FOR:\n\nWe need to get climate policy right.  I-732 has too many unintended consequences. I-732 gives tax breaks to polluters without any accountability and fails to invest in clean air and water, jobs and clean energy, or healthy forests and communities. I-732 further strips our state budget, harming education and infrastructure programs our communities need. This accelerating carbon tax will only push jobs and businesses elsewhere, and will not significantly address climate change.\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION:\n\nhttps://weiapplets.sos.wa.gov/myvote/onlinevotersguide/Measures?electionid=63&countycode=XX',

I-732 makes polluters pay. It accelerates the shift to clean energy like solar, wind, and hydropower. And it returns the money polluters pay to everyone\u2019s pocket by lowering other taxes. \n\n Clean Air, Clean Water, Healthy Forests \n\n Washington families and kids deserve a safe environment with clean air and water and healthy forests. I-732 puts a price on carbon pollution from fossil fuels like coal and oil, but not on clean energy like solar and wind. It accelerates clean energy, creating good, local jobs, while driving down the burning of fossil fuels and the pollution, asthma, and smog they cause.   \n\n Fights Pollution and Climate Change \n\n I-732 fights climate change by making big polluters pay. It\u2019s an effective, bipartisan policy similar to one that\u2019s been working successfully in British Columbia since 2008. \n\n Makes Polluters Pay. Protects Working Families. \n\n Our current tax system hits lower- and middle-income families hardest. I-732 changes that. It uses the money polluters pay to lower sales taxes, saving the average family hundreds of dollars a year. And it sends tax refunds to hundreds of thousands of working families. It makes Washington\u2019s taxes fairer as it makes our state cleaner.   \n\n Protecting our air, water, and climate just can\u2019t wait. We have a moral obligation to leave our kids a healthier, cleaner Washington! Vote Yes on I-732.\n\nREBUTTAL OF ARGUMENT AGAINST:\n\nI-732 taxes polluters and uses that money to lower sales taxes on working families. Our opponents\u2019 main argument, based on a disputed analysis, is that tax revenue over 6 years might decline less than 1%. Our main argument is that droughts, fires, and floods from climate change will definitely threaten our environment, our economy, and our kids\u2019 futures.

This would be the first Constitutional amendment since prohibition to take rights away.   \n\n Silencing speech is undemocratic \n\n Citizens should have as much opportunity to share and receive information as possible.

Vote no I-735.   \n\n Initiative 735 opens Pandora\u2019s Box \n\n Initiative 735 allows censorship of both profit and nonprofit corporations. Government would be free to censor news, books, movies, music, and your favorite charity. If a corporation made it, government could censor it.

I-735 seeks to censor corporations such as the Seattle Times, the Tacoma News Tribune, the Spokane Spokesman-Review, Disney/ABC, Comcast/NBC, Time Warner/CNN, CBS, the New York Times, Planned Parenthood, the Sierra Club, Facebook, Twitter, Google and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

          u'referendumProStatement': u"ARGUMENT FOR:\n\nBig Money is Corrupting Our Political System\n\n The 2010 Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. FEC and other cases have unleashed unlimited, anonymous campaign dollars from mega-wealthy individuals, corporations, unions, and other special interests.  SuperPACs and interest groups spent more than $1 billion on campaigns in 2012 \u2013 almost 3 times more than 2008! This year will be even worse.\n\n Instead of representing the people who elected them, many politicians spend their time courting big donors who expect favors in return. Where does that leave the voice and concerns of the average citizen? \n\n Congress Will Only Act If We Demand It\n\n Although 80% of Republicans and 83% of Democrats support overturning Citizens United, Congress will not act on its own -- politicians profit from business as usual. But when we voters put our voices on record, we hold Congress accountable for inaction. Sixteen states and over 650 municipalities have already passed measures like ours. By adding Washington to the list, we will tell our elected representatives that we want change now. \n\n A New Constitutional Amendment\n\n Initiative 735 calls on Congress to initiate a Constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United and stipulating that spending money is not protected political speech. The amendment would ensure that contributions are regulated and publicly disclosed. It would also clarify that only people have Constitutional rights -- not corporations or special interest groups.\n\n This is about restoring the power of \u201cWe the People.\u201d Let's send a clear message to the other Washington. Vote \u201cyes\u201d on Initiative 735!\n\nREBUTTAL OF ARGUMENT AGAINST:\n\nInitiative 735 will not limit freedom of speech or freedom of the press. It will keep moneyed special interests from having a louder voice than \u201cWe the People.\u201d We support Initiative 735 because we believe in freedom of speech for everyone, not just Super PACs, corporations, and wealthy individuals who monopolize the media with attack ads and misinformation. Spending unlimited, secret campaign money is legalized bribery. If you cherish free speech, vote \u201cYes\u201d on 735!\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION:\n\nhttps://weiapplets.sos.wa.gov/myvote/onlinevotersguide/Measures?electionid=63&countycode=XX\n\n----------",

          u'referendumProStatement': u'ARGUMENT FOR:\n\nWashington has one of the nation\u2019s best redistricting systems \u2013 SJR 8210 makes it better   \n\n Thirty years ago, Washington voters established a bipartisan commission to redraw political boundaries every ten years as the population grows and shifts.   This system avoids controversial, partisan redistricting and has become a model followed by numerous states.   \n\n SJR 8210 acknowledges that digital technology now enables the commission to work more efficiently. This simple yet important change shortens a year-long process by six weeks, offering benefits to voters and taxpayers alike.    \n\n Increased Public Input: SJR 8210 ensures new boundaries are adopted before busy year-end holidays   \n\n The public plays a vital role in the drawing of legislative and congressional districts.   Yet the past three redistricting plans were adopted during year-end holidays, limiting public feedback and input.  SJR 8210 sets a final deadline of November 15, ensuring the plan is adopted when the public is better able to provide feedback.     \n\n Good Government: SJR 8210 allows adequate time to implement new boundaries, saves taxpayer dollars   \n\n The current January 1 deadline leaves county officials little time to implement new boundaries before spring elections; a November 15 deadline resolves this and closes the redistricting office many weeks sooner, saving taxpayers thousands of dollars.      \n\n Common Sense: Overwhelming bipartisan support for SJR 8210   \n\n This common-sense reform passed the Legislature unanimously this year.
